# Beatrica

`beatrica` is an innovative Python package that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT and MistralAI for automating code review processes. It provides insights by analyzing differences between the current active branch and a specified base branch, processing code changes, and generating reviews to improve code quality and collaboration.

## Installation

Integrate cutting-edge code review automation into your workflow by installing `beatrica` using pip:

```bash
pip install beatrica
```

## Configuring the API Key

For Beatrica to communicate with LLM services like OpenAI or MistralAI, an API key is required. You can provide this API key in two ways:

### Using an Environment Variable

Set the API key as an environment variable before running Beatrica. This method is recommended for keeping your API key secure and not directly visible in command line history.

For Unix-like systems (Linux/macOS):

```bash
export LLM_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
```

For Windows Command Prompt:

```cmd
set LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

For Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:LLM_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
```

After setting the environment variable, you can run Beatrica without explicitly passing the API key in the command:

```bash
beatrica --base_branch=main --llm_type=openai
```

### Using the Command Line Argument

If you prefer or need to, you can directly pass the API key as a command line argument. However, be mindful of security implications such as exposing your API key in shell history or logs.

```bash
beatrica --base_branch=main --llm_type=openai --api_key='your_api_key_here'
```

Choose the method that best suits your workflow and security practices.


## Usage

Beatrica offers a CLI interface for specifying a base branch and comparing its differences with the current active branch, generating insightful reviews. Here are examples showcasing its usage with various configurations:

### Basic Usage

To analyze code differences with the `main` branch using the default OpenAI's GPT-4 model, use:

```bash
beatrica --base_branch=main --llm_type=openai
```

This command compares the current active branch against the `main` branch.

### Specifying LLM Type and Model

For a tailored review, specify the LLM (`openai` or `mistralai`) and model name:

```bash
beatrica --base_branch=main --llm_type=mistralai --model_name=mistral-large-latest
```

### Advanced Configuration

Customize further by specifying the API key (from an environment variable or directly), the maximum tokens for the LLM response, and the output format:

```bash
beatrica --base_branch=develop --llm_type=openai --model_name=gpt-4-0125-preview --api_key=YOUR_API_KEY --max_tokens=1000 --output=beatrica_review.txt
```

## Example Output

An example output of Beatrica reviewing changes between the current active branch and the `main` branch is:
